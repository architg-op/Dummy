## Mission statement

This program guides developers to build a web application  which would allow users to calculate the total cost of storage devices.

Developer needs to go through the handout carefully and plan the development accordingly. Your mentor will help you in setting up the dev environment and answering any questions.

## Competency level

**Bronz**

Entry level expertise. This includes a program which is  mandatory for a developer getting on boarded to a project.

## Reporting

During the tenure of the program attendee needs to send out work status report every 3rd day over the email. Report should contain the following items
- What is done?
- What is in progress?
- What is planned for the next 3 days?
- Impediments/blockers

## Milestones/Deliverables

1.  Boilerplate
2.  Component breakdown
3.  Unit test cases
4.  Form rendering & styling
5. Form event binding
6.  Error handling
7. Time to completion **80** hours


## Code quality parameters

80% code coverage
0  linting errors

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Application should be fully responsive.
2.  It should support internationalization.
3.  All the parameters should be completely dynamic, any addition of newer hardware needed not require any change in the UI.
4.  Application should support the latest versions of all modern browsers
